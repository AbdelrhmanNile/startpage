- Go to add ons from Firefox and select the xpi file you downloaded, it should be installed.

## Upcoming

~~I'm thinking of pushing the add on to their respective add on stores, I'll add that ASAP.~~

I thought I would work on adding a settings page that would handle the updating the settings but I'm just way to bored and honestly I've come to realize I hate GUI's (I mean I've always loved CLI based apps). Anyway, the extension can still be used and I'm sure the crowd I aimed this extension at knows how to edit a ```json``` file, for the time being I'll just let you guys install it and use it and edit the settings from the ```config```.

## Settings

For the time being you need to edit the ```config.json``` file present in the root directory of the repo and then install the extension by following the above steps.
